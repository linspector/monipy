MAJOR.FEATURE.MINOR.FIXES
MAJOR changes can change the API. The lesser, the better.
FEATURE changes can, but should not break the API. New features are placed here. It expects a 
complete documentation.
MINOR changes are "just-in-time" changes or small enhancements which should not affect the 
documentation.
FIXES should never affect anything else then stability or security.
